// PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING
/*
focus is on processes or actions or actions that a program takes
Programs are typicaly a collection of functions
Data is declared separately
Data is passed as arguments into functions
Fairly easy to learn
*/

// Procedural programming -Limitations
/*
    Functions need to know the structure of the data.
        if the structure of the data changes many functions must be changes
    As a program get lager they become more:
        difficult to understand
        difficult to maintain
        difficult to extend
        difficult to debug
        difficult to reuse code
        fragile and easier to break

// Object oriented means modeling the software in terms of classes and objects
