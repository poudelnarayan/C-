Why Use STL?

At its core STL is an assortment of commonly used container.
The algorithms provided by the STL have published and well understood time and size complexity information.
That means when you use the containers and algorithm in the STL  there are no surprises. You know exactly how the algorithm
behave as the size of the collection increases.
The STL has been aroud a long time . It's been tried and tested across many millions of lines of code.
The STL is consistant , fast , type safe as wll as extensible.

The STL has three main components:

> Containers
    . Collections of objects or primitive types.
        (array,vector,deque,stack,set,map etc)


> Algorithm
    . functions for processing sequence of element from containers
        (find, max, count , sort) etc

> Iterators
    . generate sequence of element from containers
        (forward,reverse,by value, by refrence , constant etc)
